# Candidate RAG Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for candidate selection, built with Flask and Weaviate. This API provides a natural language interface to query candidate profiles stored in a Weaviate vector database.

## Overview

This chatbot enables hiring managers to interact with candidate data using natural language queries. The system leverages Weaviate's Query Agent to perform semantic searches, retrieve relevant candidate profiles, and generate conversational responses.

Key features:
- Natural language queries for candidate selection
- Contextual follow-up questions
- Automated candidate scoring and evaluation
- Conversation history tracking

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [Weaviate Cloud](https://weaviate.io/cloud) account with a running instance
- OpenAI API key for the LLM component

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd candidate-rag-chatbot
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
